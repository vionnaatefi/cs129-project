# cs129-project

PYTHON CODE FOR DATA IMPORTATION & PROCESSSING IS INCLUDED IN part1_data_importation_and_processing

Downloading the text files as part of the cloned github folder is necessary to get the code to work (the code needs to read the text files under the 
names in the folder and use that text to train the word vectors) 

Make sure you've downloaded jupyter notebook to get these files to run:

(I think this command line works to install jupyter notebook)

TERMINAL: 

pip3 install jupyter

& START UP JUPYTER NOTEBOOK IN THE TERMINAL WITH: 

jupyter notebook

(This should open a window for your jupyter notebook on an internet browser)

Make sure you've cloned the github: 

COMMAND LINE IN TERMINAL: git clone https://github.com/vionnaatefi/cs129-project.git
